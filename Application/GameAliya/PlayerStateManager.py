#
# An example for an SQL manager server using asyncio programming methods.
# We will use aiohttp library to network these API calls so that they can be
# accessed from different physical devices on the network.
# Additionally, we will be using tormysql library to manage the SQL server pool
# of connections.
#
# All functions that connect to the database should be async. The more async code
# we use, the faster the entire server becomes.
#
#
# The file has two parts:
#	- The DefaultManager class
#	- The aiohttp server bindings for the class methods
